Bitwig randomizer

## WARNING

This WILL lead to unexpected results, be sure to lower your volume before using.

## Motivation

I enjoy surprises, and I think that creativity comes from constraints.

So I wanted to make a script that would randomly select a Bitwig browser item.
This allows me two main things:
- Select unexpected items, which open up possibilities for me to explore.
- Force me to use a forgotten device, plugin… etc. to try to master it.

I added a name genarator, wich tries to be inspiring.
It can be used to name devices, tracks, presets, etc., but also to name projects.

## Activation

Copy the released extension to your Bitwig extensions folder.

Activate it in the settings.

## Usage

### Browser random selection

This extension allows users to select a random item from the browser.
It could be any browser related item type, like device, plugin, wave file, preset, modulator…

- `Select random item` opens a browser if none is already opened and selects a random item from the current opened browser.

- `Add current item` adds the current selected item.
  This is the same as `OK` in the browser.
  For me, it is convenient as it is close to the random button.

An option is available to prepend the generated filename with the current date.
